# Black Family History

Hudson Alpha Tech Challenge 2019 Challenge 2 Submission

## Challenge 👀

**[Linking Family History Data through Blockchain](https://hudsonalpha.org/techchallenge/challenge-three.html)**

This challenge requires teams to design a tool that can link family medical history data supplied by different family members together to create a ‘master’ family history for all linked family members using blockchain technology. Teams should focus on chain of custody as individual patients should be able to see their own family history data, but not what other members of the family have contributed. Additionally, a medical practice or physician, should have the ability to see both an individual’s contribution to family history as well as the ‘master’ family history generated. As privacy is key, this solution must be decentralized and keep personally identifiable information encrypted and from being accessed by non-authorized individuals. It is recommended that power of work can be ignored in this challenge.

## What’s tricky about African American Family History?🤔

---

Some African Americans may think that researching their family tree is impossible beyond 1870, when all of our ancestors were free and therefore listed by first and last name in the federal census. 

However, If you descend from a black ancestor who was freed before the Civil War, she or he would have been listed in the census by name, and in other documents, just like any other free person; but slaves were not, making it extraordinarily difficult to trace them in the era of slavery.
